# My First Convolutional Neural Network - Man or Machine?
Here I present my first convolutional neural network that can distinguish between images of humans and machines. The machines that I used to train the network include images of telephones and televisions. I felt that classifying human versus machine was fun and fitting for my first project in artificial intelligence, since the goal of the field is to integrate man and machine and eventually make them indistinguishable.     

I used the CIFAR-100 image dataset for my network. I used 2400 training images, 600 validation images, and 600 testing images. The training accuracy is approximately ~0.8733 and validation accuracy is ~0.8800. I was limited by the size of my training dataset, and to improve performance I would need a much larger set of images.
